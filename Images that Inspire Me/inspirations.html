  <h2> Cover Art from Volume 2 of <em>Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan</em> by Hirohiko Araki</h2>
  <p> Hirohiko Araki, the author of this manga as well as its parent series, <em>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</em>, is a big source of my inspiration towards design due to it's unique artstyle and character design. Some of his work is also on display in the Louvre! </p>

  <h2> "Couple" Painting by David Mellon </h2>
  <p> David Mellon is my great uncle, and is an amazing artist. Meeting him and learning about his artwork was one of my first and favorite experiences with art and design. He also has written a book called "Silent".</p>

  <h2> Panel from the manga <em>Uzumaki</em> by Junji Ito</h2>
  <p> Junji Ito is very famous for his horrifying artwork. I personally love how his form of horror focuses less on gore and more on niche psychological concepts, such as spirals (as seen in Uzumaki).</p>
